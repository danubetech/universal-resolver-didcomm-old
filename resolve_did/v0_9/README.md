This is a rather prototypical implementation to resolve DIDs, following
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0124-did-resolution-protocol#resolve-message

Missing:
- use aries-cloudagent to resolve :sov DIDs
- adding additional features/options as described in the RFC
- better inline documentation
- cleanup clode, error handling, robustness
- add tests
